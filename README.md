# Stomata-microscope
Non-invasive microscopic imaging of individual stomatal kinetics in the growth environment with high resolution


Stomata regulate the gas exchange with the environment, balancing between water loss and CO2 uptake. Gas-exchange dynamics are influenced by stomatal morphology, size and density that are commonly investigated using imprint and SEM, methods that are destructive and elaborate. Moreover, these microscopic properties are statically sampled and related to the dynamic ensemble behavior: gas exchange of an entire plant or part of a leaf. Little is known on how morphology, size and density of stomata influence the kinetic behavior of individual stomata. The compact microscope system described here measures individual stomatal aperture kinetics of tens of stomata with sub-minute time resolution in vivo in the growth environment with minimal impact to the leafâ€™s surrounding . Sub-micron apertures can be resolved, capturing the dynamics accurately even at low light intensities. Simultaneous chlorophyll fluorescence, ambient temperature, humidity and light intensity measurements enable the investigation of environmental parameters on the dynamics of individual stomata. The characteristics of our microscope and data analyses are described in this open science project.

Design principle

The microscope is designed to image stomata non-inbasively in the growth environment, therefore the following demands had to be met by the microscope: 
                  low light intensity for imaging light (to least affect the stomatal behaviour), 
                  high resolution (to resolve minimal apertures), 
                  long working distance (to keep the leaf in its natural surrounding as much as possible), 
                  A clamp that keeps the leaf in position but doesnt affect its physiology
                  control over stimulus light to affect the stomatal behavior
                  Autofocus, to follow the movement of the leaf surface over time on the z-axis when the leaf turgor changes,
                  A speed of imaging that could resolve the surface of the leaf within a minute or less
                 
To meet this demands we used the following approach:

Imaging light was either green or near infrared, the latter with the least impact on the stomatal physiology but with lower resolving power, and a filter was used to only image in this wavelength range (monochromatic). This choice was made to minimize chromatic abberations and to be at the maximum sensitivity of the cameras that we employed. Additionally both wavelengths are  reflected/transmitted well by the leaf surface and thereby enable imaging in bright or darkfield mode.

The microscope objectives used were all from mitutoyo, ranging from 20x to 50x with NA from 0.42 to 0.75 and with working distances of XX to XX mm
