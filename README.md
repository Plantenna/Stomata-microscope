# Stomata-microscope
Non-invasive microscopic imaging of individual stomatal kinetics in the growth environment with high resolution


Stomata regulate the gas exchange with the environment, balancing between water loss and CO2 uptake. Gas-exchange dynamics are influenced by stomatal morphology, size and density that are commonly investigated using imprint and SEM, methods that are destructive and elaborate. Moreover, these microscopic properties are statically sampled and related to the dynamic ensemble behavior: gas exchange of an entire plant or part of a leaf. Little is known on how morphology, size and density of stomata influence the kinetic behavior of individual stomata. The compact microscope system described here measures individual stomatal aperture kinetics of tens of stomata with sub-minute time resolution in vivo in the growth environment with minimal impact to the leafâ€™s surrounding . Sub-micron apertures can be resolved, capturing the dynamics accurately even at low light intensities. Simultaneous chlorophyll fluorescence, ambient temperature, humidity and light intensity measurements enable the investigation of environmental parameters on the dynamics of individual stomata. The characteristics of our microscope and data analyses are described in this open science project.
